    "A friend of mine is a good cook and moving from another city to Chicago with a plan to open a restuarant. He asked my help to find a best community that fits his needs. \n",
    "His requirements are, The place and surroundings should have sizable middle age people and good employment rate. Also since he is going to open a Mexican restuarant there should be a sizable Latino and Hispanic community in the neighbourhood but not with many mexican restuarants around. Also his resturant price range is going to be Moderate to High so the community income should be decent to afford."
